江西道一禪師，				  MASTER TAO I (Ma Tsu) of the south of the River 
漢州什邡人也，				  was a man from Shih Fang Province of Han State. 
姓馬氏。				  His surname was Ma, 
容貌¶奇異，				  and his appearance was strange. 
牛行虎視，				  He walked like an ox and looked at things like a tiger. 
引舌過鼻，				  When he spread out his tongue it covered his nose, 
足下有二輪文。				  and he had two wheel-shaped marks on his feet. 
幼¶歲依資州唐和尚落髮，			  When young, he had his head shaved by Venerable T'ang Ho of Tzu State, 
受具於渝州圓律師。			  and he received the Complete Precepts from Vinaya Master Yuan. 
¶唐開元中，				  During the era of K'ai Yuan (713-741 A.D.) of the T'ang dynasty 
習禪定於衡嶽傳法院，			  he practiced Ch'an samadhi at Ch'uan Fa Temple of Heng Mountain, 
遇讓和尚。				  where he met with Master Huai ]ang. 
¶同參九人，				  He became one of the nine monks under this master, 
唯師密受心印				  but was the only one of them who received the secret spiritual seal.
(讓之一猶思之遷也。
同源而異派。
故禪法之盛始于¶二師。
劉軻云。
江西主大寂。
湖南主石頭。
往來憧憧不見二大士為無知矣。
西天般若多羅記達磨云。
震旦雖闊無¶別路。
要假姪孫脚下行。
金雞解銜一顆米。
供養十方羅漢僧。
又六祖能和尚謂讓曰。
向後佛法從汝邊去。
馬駒蹋
<pb:T_T51n2076_0246a>
¶殺天下人。
厥後江西法嗣布於天下。
時號馬祖焉)
始自建陽佛迹嶺遷至臨¶川，		From Buddha Trace Cliff at Chien Yang, the Master first moved to Lin Ch'uan; 
次至南康龔公山。			then later he went to Kung Kung Mountain in Nan K'ang, 
大歷中，				and during the Ta Li era (766-779 A.D.) 
隷名於開元精¶舍。			he joined K'ai Yuan Temple. 
時連帥路嗣恭。			On hearing of his reputation, Lien Shuai and Lu Szu Kung
聆風景慕，			came in person to accept the religion; 
親受宗旨。			and because of this, students
由是¶四方學者雲集坐下。		from the four directions assembled like clouds under his seat.

一日，				One day 
謂眾曰︰				he said to the congregation: 
「汝等諸人，			"You brothers should each
¶各信自				apprehend that 
心是佛，				your mind is the Buddha. 
此心即是佛心。			This mind of yours is the Buddha mind. 
達磨大師從¶南天竺國來，		When Bodhidharma came from Southern India 
躬至中華，				  to China and transmitted 
傳上乘一心之法，			  the supreme teaching of One Mind, 
¶令汝等開悟。				  he enabled us to comprehend the meaning of enlightenment. 
又引					  He also quoted passages of the
《楞伽經》文，				  Lankatavara Sutra and thus 
以印眾生心地，				  imprinted the mind-ground of humanity upon us.
¶恐汝顛倒，				  Perhaps you do not believe in yourselves because
不自信。				  of the mistaken, upside-down view that each of you has—
此心之法，				  the view of 'mind 
各各有之。				  within yourself . 
故《楞¶伽經》云︰			  Therefore it is said in the Lankavatara Sutra: 
『佛語心為宗，				  'The Buddha-word takes mind as its essential and 
無門為法門。』」			  no-gate as its doctrine'. 

又云︰					  It is also said: 
「夫求¶法者，				  'Those who seek for the truth 
應無所求，				  must realize the fact that there is 
心外無別佛，				  no Buddha outside mind, and 
佛外無別心。				  there is no mind apart from Buddha'. 
不¶取善，				  Do not accept the good and 
不捨惡，				  reject the bad; 
淨穢兩邊俱不依怙。			  depend neither on purity at one extreme nor on impurity at the other extreme.
達罪性空，				  Then you will realize the voidness of the nature of sin, 
¶念念不可得，				  and that there is nothing to be grasped at in each moment. 
無自性故，				  Nothing has self-nature,
故三界唯心。				  and the triple worlds (the realm of desires, the realm of form, and the realm of spirit) are but mind; 
森羅萬¶象，				  all the myriad manifestations of the universe 
一法之所印，				  are that which is imprinted by one thing—namely, mind.
凡所見色，				  All that is seen 
皆是見心，				  is no other than mind. 
心不自¶心，				  However, this mind is not merely self-existent; 
因色故有。				  it is also dependent on plurality of material existences.
汝但隨時言說，				  It is a principle and at the same time it is a matter of practice; 
即事即理，				  that is to say, it is subjective and at the same time it is objective. 
都¶無所礙，
菩提道果，
亦復如是。
於心所生，
即名¶為色，
知色空故，
生即不生。				  In other words, the life is not the life. 
若了此心，				  One who comprehends this mind lives,
乃可隨¶時著衣喫飯，			  dresses, and eats in accordance with what is proper in each situation,
長養聖胎，				  and passes the time in spontaneity. 
任運過時，
更有何事？
¶汝受吾教，
聽吾偈曰︰				  To understand my teaching, listen to this poem:
『¶
#+BEGIN_VERSE
心地隨時說，				  Mind-ground expresses itself in accordance with the time.
菩提亦只寧。¶				  Bodhi is identical to it.
事理俱無礙，				  The principle and its application are interfused without impediment.
當生即不生。				  (There is) life, and at the same time, not life.
#+END_VERSE¶
』」
******* 
僧問︰					  A monk asked, 
「和尚為什麼說即心即佛？」		  "Master, why do you preach that mind is Buddha?"

師云︰					  The Master answered, 
「為止小¶兒啼。」			  "Because I have to stop a baby from crying."


僧云︰					  The monk asked again, 
「啼止時如何？」			  "What would you say when the crying has ceased?"

師云︰					  The Master answered, 
「非心非佛。」				  "I would say, `There is neither mind nor Buddha'."

僧¶云︰					  The monk asked, 
「除此二種人來，			  "How would you direct a man who has gone
如何指示？」				  beyond both statements?"

師云︰					  The Master replied, 
「向伊道不¶是物。」			  "I would say to him that it is not a thing."

僧云︰					  The monk asked, 
「忽遇其中人				  "How would you direct a man who belongs
來時如何？」				  to none of these and suddenly comes to ask about the Tao?"

師云︰					  The Master answered, 
「且教¶伊體會大道。」			  "I would let him comprehend the great Tao."
******* 
僧問︰					  A monk asked, 
「如何是西來意？」			  "What is the message of Bodhidharma coming from India?"

師云︰
「即今¶是什麼意？」
******* 
龐居士問︰				  Layman P'ang Yun asked, 
「如水無筋骨，				  "What is the reason the water, which has no bones or muscles, 
能勝萬斛¶舟，				  can support ships holding vast quantities of goods?"
此理如何？」

師云︰					  The Master answered, 
「遮裏無水亦無舟，			  "Here is no water and no ship either. 
說什¶麼筋骨！」				  What is the use of talking about the muscles and bones?"
******* 
一日，					  One day 
師上堂，				  the Master ascended the dais in the hall of the monastery.
良久，					  After a short silence, 
百丈收却面前席；			  Baizhang rolled up the mat in front of him (to indicate that the sermon was finished). 
¶師便下堂，				  Thereupon the Master descended from the dais.
百丈問︰				  Baizhang asked, 
「如何是佛法旨趣。？」			  "What is the message of Buddhism?"
師云︰					  The Master answered, 
「正<pb:T_T51n2076_0246b>¶		  "This 
是汝放身命處。」			  is the matter for which you let your body and life go."
******* 
師問百丈︰				  The Master asked Baizhang, 
「汝以何法示人？」			  "What teaching will you preach to people?" 
百¶丈竪起拂子。				  Thereupon Baizhang raised up the dust-whisk. 
師云︰					  The Master asked, 
「只遮箇，				  "What else 
為當別有？」				  will you preach?" 
百丈¶拋下拂子。				  Baizhang put the dustwhisk down.
******* 
僧問︰					  A monk asked, 
「如何得合道？」			  "How can we be in accord with the Tao?"
師云︰					  The Master answered, 
「我早不合¶道。」			  "I have not been in accord with the Tao since my early days."
******* 
僧問︰					  A monk asked, 
「如何是西來意？」			  "What is the message of Bodhidharma coming from India?" 
師便打，				  The Master struck him 
乃云︰					  and said, 
「我若不¶打汝，				  "If I didn't strike you,
諸方笑我也。」				  masters in other places would laugh at me."
******* 
有小師行脚迴，				  After returning from his study-pilgrimage, 
於師前畫¶箇圓相，			  a disciple drew a circle in front of the Master, 
就上禮拜了立，				  stood within it, and bowed. 
師云︰					  The Master asked,
「汝莫欲作佛否？」¶			  "Do you wish to make of it a Buddha, or not?"
云︰					  The monk answered, 
「某甲不解揑目。」			  "I do not know how to fabricate the eyes."
師云︰					  The Master remarked, 
「吾不如汝。」				  "I cannot do any better than you."
小師不對。				  The disciple made no response.
******* 
¶鄧隱峯辭師，				  When Peng Dengyin was taking his leave of the Master, 
師云︰					  he was asked, 
「什麼處去？」				  "Where do you intend to go?"
對云︰					  He' answered, 
「石頭去。」				  "I am going to Shih T'ou, Sir."
¶師云︰					  The Master remarked, 
「石頭路滑。」				  "The way to Shih T'ou is slippery."
對云︰					  Feng Dengyin said in return, 
「竿木隨身，				  "Bamboo groves and forests are on the way I shall follow, 
逢場作戲。」				  and in such places I shall enjoy nature."
便¶去。					  Then he left.
******* 
纔到石頭，				  Arriving at the place where Shih T'ou 
即繞禪床一匝，				  was seated on the Ch'an seat, he walked around him, 
振錫一聲，				  shook his stick, and 
問︰					  made this challenge:
「是¶何宗旨？」				  "What school of the teaching do you profess?"
石頭云︰				  Shih T'ou answered, 
「蒼天！				  "It is fine today, 
蒼天！」				  it is fine today."
隱峯無語，				  Feng Dengyin had no word to say. 
却迴，					  He returned and 
舉¶似於師，				  related the story to Master Ma Tsu, 
師云︰					  who instructed him, 
「汝更去，				  "You are to go back
見他道蒼天，				  again, and if he says 'It is fine today' 
汝便噓¶噓。」				  you must make a deep sigh."

隱峯又去石頭，				  Accordingly, the monk went back to Shih T'ou and 
一依前問︰				  repeated the same catechism as before. 
「是何宗旨？」				  But this time when asked what school of teaching he professed, 
石頭¶乃噓噓。				  Shih T'ou uttered a deep sigh. 
隱峯又無語。				  Teng Yin Feng again had no word to say.

歸來，					  Upon his return 
師云︰					  the Master said, 
「向汝道。				  "I warned you that the way
石¶頭路滑。」				  to Shih T'ou was slippery."
******* 
有僧於師前作四畫，			  Once a monk drew four strokes in front of the Master. 
上一長，				  There was a long line at the top and 
下三短，				  three short lines beneath it.
¶問云︰					  The monk said, 
「不得道一長三短，			  "You cannot say that the one is long and the three are short. 
離此四字外，				  Apart from these four strokes, what is the truth? 
請和尚¶答。」				  Pray, Master, would you mind answering my question'?"

師乃畫地一畫，				  The Master then drew a stroke on the ground and 
云︰					  commented,
「不得道長短，				  "This cannot be said to be long or short. 
答汝了也。」				  This is my answer to your question."
¶
(忠國師聞，
別云︰
「何不問老僧？)」
******* 
有一講僧來，				  There came a scholarly monk, 
問云︰					  who asked, 
「未審禪宗傳持¶何法？」			  "What teaching does Ch'an Buddhism convey?"

師却問云︰				  The Master asked, 
「坐主傳持何法？」			  "What message do you convey?"

彼云︰					  The monk said, 
「忝講得¶經論二十餘本。」		  "I am happy to say that I am able to discourse on more than twenty books of sutras and commentaries."

師云︰					  (The Buddha is often known as the lion of men, and) the Master commented, 
「莫是師子兒否？」			  "Don't you think yourself lion-hearted!"

云︰					  The monk said, 
「不敢。」				  "Thank you."
¶師作噓噓聲。				  The Master sighed deeply, and 
彼云︰					  the monk said, 
「此是法。」				  "This is a teaching."

師云︰					  The Master asked, 
「是什麼法？」				  "What teaching is it?"

云︰¶					  He answered, 
「師子出窟法。」			  "It is the teaching of the lion coming out of his cave."
師乃默然。				  The Master kept silent. 

彼云︰					  The monk then remarked, 
「此亦是法。」				  "This, also, is a teaching."

師云︰					  The Master asked, 
「¶是什麼法？」				  "What teaching is it?"

云︰					  He answered, 
「師子在窟法。」			  "It is the teaching of the lion in his cave."

師云︰					  The Master asked, 
「不出不入是¶什麼法？」			  "What is the teaching of neither coming out nor staying in?"
無對。					  The monk had no response to make  and decided to leave. 
(百丈代云︰
「見麼？)」
遂辭出門，				  He was going out of the gate when 
師召云︰				  the Master called after him,
「坐主！」				  "Venerable Sir!" 
¶彼即迴首。				  He turned his head, 
師云︰					  and the Master asked, 
「是什麼？」				  "What is it?"
亦無對。				  Again he made no response. 
師云︰					  The Master remarked, 
「遮鈍¶根阿師。」			  "Such a stupid fellow."
******* 
洪州廉使問云︰				  The provincial judge of Hongzhou asked, 
「弟子喫酒肉即是？			  "Should I take wine and meat, 
不¶喫即是？」				  or should I abstain from them?"
師云︰					  The Master answered, 
「若喫，				  "If you take them 
是中丞祿；				  they are gifts to Your Worship, 
不喫，					  and if you abstain from them 
是中丞福。」				  they are blessings to Your Worship."

¶
師入室弟子一百三十九人，		  The Master had 139 disciples who received his personal training
各為一方宗主，				  and became spiritual leaders, each in a different district. Their
¶轉化無窮。				  missionary activities were endless. In January of the fourth year of
師於貞元四年正月中，			  Cheng Yuan (788 A.D.) the Master climbed up through the forest
登建昌石				  of Shih Men Mountain of Chien Ch'ang State. Looking at the floor
<pb:T_T51n2076_0246c>			  of a cavernous gully, he said to his attendant, "This decaying body
¶門山，					  of mine will return to this earth next month." After this statement
於林中經行，				  he had a slight illness. As predicted, on February 4th, after taking
見洞壑平坦處，				  a bath, he passed away sitting in the lotus posture.
謂侍者曰︰
「¶吾之朽質，
當於來月歸茲地矣。」			  During the era of Yuan Ho (806-820 A.D.) the posthumous title
言					  of Master Ta Chi (Great Silence) was conferred on him. His stupa,

至¶二月四日，				  Shadow in Hai Hun Prefecture.
果有微疾，
沐浴訖，
跏趺入滅。				  MASTER TA CHU (GREAT PEARL) HUI HAI of Yueh State was
元和¶中，				  a man from Chien State; his surname was Chu. He was ordained as
追諡大寂禪師，				  a homeless monk by Venerable Tao Chih of Ta Yun Temple in Yueh
塔曰大莊嚴，				  State. Immediately after his ordination he went south of the River
今海昏縣影¶堂存焉
(高僧傳云。				  191.

****** 懷讓禪師第二世

馬祖法嗣				  He answered, "1 have come from Ta Yun Temple of Yueh State."
					  Ma Tsu asked, "What do you expect to do by coming here?"
¶					  He replied, "I have come to seek for Buddha-Dharma."

越州大珠慧海禪師者，
建州人也，				  Ma Tsu asked, "What do you mean by abandoning your own
姓朱氏。
依¶越州大雲寺道智和尚受業。
初至江西參馬¶祖，			  can you be seeking for?"
祖問曰︰
「從何處來？」
					  Thereupon Hui Hai bowed and asked, "What is this treasurestorehouse
					  of mine?"
曰︰
「越州大雲寺來。」
					  Ma Tsu a,nswered, "That which is now questioning me is the
祖¶曰︰					  very treasure-house you own. Everything is kept in it; there is nothing
「來此擬須何事？」			  lacking. You are free to use the things in it. Why do you seek for
					  anything outside?"
曰︰
「來求佛法。」
					  As this statement struck him, Hui Hai grasped for himself the
祖曰︰					  realization that the original mind of a man does not depend on
「自家寶¶藏不顧，			  perception. He skipped for joy when he appreciated the full meaning,
拋家散走作什麼？			  and he served Master Ma Tsu for six years. Later, when his ordination
我遮裏一物也無，			  teacher grew old, he hastened back to support him.
¶求什麼佛法？」

師遂禮拜，				  Obscuring his traces and concealing his activities, Master Hui
問曰︰					  Hai pretended to be a fool, but he distinguished himself by writing
「阿那箇是慧海¶自家寶藏？」		  a book in one scroll entitled The Essentials of Entering into the Tao by
					  Abrupt Awakening. A teacher of the doctrine, Chih Hsuan Yen,
祖曰︰					  secretly took the scroll across the river and presented it to Master
「即今問我者，				  Ma Tsu. After reading it to the congregation, Master Ma Tsu said,
是汝寶藏。				  "In Yueh State there is a great pearl which is round and clear. Its
一切¶具足，				  light penetrates freely through everything without obstruction."
更無欠少，				  Among the congregation members there were a few who knew that
使用自在，				  the surname of the Master was Chu (a word which also means
何假向外求覓？」			  "pearl"). Although they knew each other only slightly, they became
師¶於言下自識本心不由知覺，		  sworn friends and agreed to journey to Yueh State and stay there for
踊躍禮謝，				  instruction.
師事¶六載。
後以受業師年老，
遽歸奉養，				  (When they got there) the Master addressed them as follows: "My
乃晦迹藏¶用，				  Ch'an guests, I do not understand what C,h'an is; bcsides, I have not
外示癡訥。				  a single teaching to show anyone, so yoû need not stand for a long

自撰					  Then students gathered increasingly by day and night, and he was

師謂曰︰
「禪客！				  They asked, "Who is the Buddha?"
我不¶會禪，
並無一法可示於人，

(廣。					  After a pause, one of the monks asked another question. "What

¶曰︰					  The Master answered, "I have never preached any dharma for
「擬伸一問，				  liberating people."
師還對否？」

					  The monk remarked, "All Ch'an masters say such things."
師曰︰					  The Master asked in return, "What kind of teaching do you

問︰					  The monk answered, "I have been discoursing on the Diamond

師曰︰

¶眾皆茫然。

(法眼云︰				  The monk said, "More than twenty times."
「是即沒交涉。)」

良久，					  The Master asked, "Who delivered this sutra?"
其僧又問︰
「師說何法¶度人？」
					  The monk protested loudly: "Master, you are teasing me! How
師曰︰					  could you be ignorant of such a thing?"
「貧道未曾有一法度人。」

曰︰					  The Master commented, "If a man should say that the Tathagata
「禪師家				  delivered the teaching, he would be slandering the Buddha. Such a
<pb:T_T51n2076_0247a>			  man does not understand the meaning of what is said. If he should
¶渾如此。」				  say that the sutra was not delivered by the Buddha, he would be
					  slandering the sutra. Pray, Venerable Sir, l would like you to comment
師却問曰︰				  on this point.".
「大德說何法度人？」

曰︰					  No response was .given. After a pause, the Master said, "It says
「講					  in the sutra: 'If people see me in form, or seek me in voice, such
《金¶剛般若經》。」			  people follow the wrong way and cannot see the Tathagata.' Tell me,
					  Venerable Sir, what is the Tathagata?"
師曰︰
「講幾坐來？」
					  The monk said, "I am puzzléd by the question."
曰︰
「二十餘坐。」
					  The Master retorted, "You have never been enlightened in any
					  way, or how could you say that you are puzzled by the question?"
師曰︰
「¶此經是阿誰說？」
					  The monk begged, "Pray, Master, would you mind explaining
僧抗聲曰︰				  it for me?"
「禪師相弄！
豈不知¶是佛說耶？」
					  The Master said, "Venerable Teacher, you have discoursed on
師曰︰					  the sutra at more than twenty gatherings without comprehending what
「若言如來有所說法，			  the Tathagata meant."
則為謗¶佛，
是人不解我所說義；			  193
若言此經不是佛說，
¶則是謗經，
請大德說看。」				  Bowing, the monk again begged for instruction.
無對。

師少頃又問︰				  The Master then said, "The Tathagata means the ultimate reality
「經¶云︰				  of all things. How can you forget it?"
『若以色見我，
以音聲求我，
是人行邪道，				  The monk said, "Yes, that's right, that's right. It means the
不¶能見如來。』				  ultimate reality of all things."
大德！
且道。
阿那箇是如來？」			  The Master replied, "What your ability thinks to be right is not
					  yet right."
曰︰
「某甲¶到此却迷去。」
					  The monk said, "The text of the sutra affirms it clearly; how
師曰︰					  can it not be right?"
「從來未悟，
說什麼却迷！」
					  The Master said, "Venerable Monk, are you in accord with that
僧¶曰︰					  reality or not?"
「請禪師為說。」

師曰︰					  The monk,answered, "Yes, I am."
「大德講經二十餘坐
，
却¶未識如來。」				  The Master asked, "Is your reality the same as the reality of trees
其僧再禮拜，				  and stones, or not?"
願垂開示。

師曰︰					  The monk answered, "They are not dual."
「如來¶者，
是諸法如義，
何得忘却？」				  The Master asked, "Then why is your venerable self different
					  from trées and stones?"
曰︰
「是！
是諸法如¶義。」				  The monk made no response, but after a pause countered by
					  asking, "How can I attain the great nirvana?"
師曰︰
「大德！
是亦未是。」				  The Master answered, "Don't commit actions leading to life and
					  death."
曰︰
「經文分明，
那得未¶是？」				  The monk asked, "What are the actions leading to life and
					  death?"

師曰︰
「大德如否？」				  The Master said, "It is an action for life and death to seek for
					  the great nirvana. It is an action for life and death to abandon dust
曰︰					  and grasp purity. It is an action for lifc and dcath to obtain shmething,
「如。」				  or to have an evidence of something. lt is an action for life and death
					  not to get rid of the gates of discrimination."
師曰︰
「木石如否？」
					  The monk asked, "How can I gain emancipation?"
曰︰
「¶如。」
					  The Master answered, "There is no bondage from the beginning,
師曰︰					  so don't seek to get rid of it. The unequalled Way is direct functioning
「大德如同木石如否？」			  and direct action."

曰︰
「無二。」				  The monk remarked, "One like this Ch'an master is indeed rare."
					  Grateful for the instruction, he went away.
師曰︰
「¶大德與木石何別？」
					  There was a layman who asked, "If human mind is the Buddha,
僧無對，				  what is the Buddha?"
良久，
却問︰
「如何得¶大涅槃？」			  Thc Master answered, "Which one do you suppose is not the
					  Buddha? Do you feel doubtful? If you point at someone, I will see
師曰︰					  him."
「不造生死業對。」

曰︰					  The monk had no reply.
「如何是生死¶業？」
					  194
師曰︰
「求大涅槃是生死業，
捨垢取淨是生¶死業，			  The Master continued, "When you reach the goal, the whole
有得有證是生死業，			  universe will become right. But if you do not comprehend the truth,
不脫對治門是生¶死業。」			  you will forever be at odds with things."

曰︰
「云何即得解脫？」			  There was a master of the Vinaya School named Fa Ming, who
					  commented, "Ch'an masters are mostly taken up with the idea of
師曰︰					  voidnt:ss."
「本自無縛，
不用¶求解。
直用直行，				  The Master exclaimed, "On the contrary, it is the school you
是無等等。」				  belong to which generally inclines to voidness."


僧曰︰					  Greatly astonished, Fa Ming protested, "How do we incline to
「如禪師和尚¶者，			  voidness?"
實謂希有。」
禮謝而去。
					  The Master said, "Sutras and sastras are no other than paper and
有行者問︰				  ink and letters. Paper and ink and letters are all void. Even if such
「即心即佛，				  things as nouns and phrases are created, they are still nothing but
¶那箇是佛？」				  voidness. Your speaking is attached to the letter of the doctrine; how
					  could you be free from inclining towards voidness?"
師云︰
「汝疑那箇不是佛？
指出看。」				  Fa Ming asked, "And do you, Venerable Sir, incline to voidness
無¶對。					  or not?"

師云︰
「達即遍境是，				  The Master answered, "I do not incline to voidness."
不悟永乖疎。」

有律師¶法明。				  Fa Ming asked, "Why do you not incline toward voidness?"
謂師曰︰				  The Master replied, "All letters, together with everything else,
「禪師家多落空。」

師曰︰					  function of wisdom is present?"
「却是坐主¶家多落空。」

法明大驚，				  Fa Ming remarked, "Therefore, I realize that [Gautama Buddha]
曰︰					  would not have been named Siddhartha (realization of all aims) if there
「何得落空？」				  had been even a single thing he had not penetrated."

師曰︰
「經論¶是紙墨文字，			  The Master said, "You, Venerable Vinaya Master, not only
紙墨文字者俱空，			  incline to voidness, but you misuse your nouns."
設於聲上建¶立名句等法，
無非是空。
坐主執滯教體，				  Fa Ming turned pale and asked, "In what point am I mistaken?"
豈¶不落空？」

法明					  The Master answered, "Venerable Sir, you are not yet well
曰︰					  informed of the differences between Chinese words and Sanskrit
「禪師落空否？」			  words. How then can you discourse on the sutras?"

師曰︰
「不落空。」				  Fa Ming demanded, "Pray, Master, indicate the point where I
					  am in error."

<pb:T_T51n2076_0247b>
¶曰︰					  The Master said, "Don't you know that 'Hsi Ta' (Siddhartha,
「何却不落空？」			  Siddham) means the Sanskrit alphabet?"

師曰︰
「文字等皆從智慧而生，			  The Vinaya Master realized his slip and was very angry with the
¶大用現前，				  Master.
那得落空？」

法明曰︰				  He asked again, "Sutras, vinayas, sastras are taken from the
「故知一法不達，			  Buddha's words, so why should we not get enlightenment by following
¶不名悉達。」				  the doctrinal teaching?"

					  �ne
師曰︰
「律師不唯落空，
兼乃錯用名¶言。」			  The Master answered, "It is like a foolish dog running after a
					  lump (of meat), or a lion biting a man. Sutras, vinayas and sastras
法明作色，				  are (merely) the applications of the self-nature. Those who read them
問曰︰					  are the principle of that nature."
「何處是錯？」

師曰︰					  Fa Ming asked, "Has Amitabha Buddha a father, a mother, and
「律師未辨¶華竺之音，			  a family name, or not?"
如何講說？」

曰︰					  The Master replied, "Amitabha's family name is Chiao Shih
「請禪師指出法明錯¶處。」		  Chia. His father was named Yueh Shang and his mother was named
					  Excellent Looking Face."
師曰︰
「豈不知悉達是梵語邪？」
律師雖省¶過，				  Fa Ming asked, "In which scriptural writing is this found?"
而心猶憤然				  The Master answered, "It is in the Collection of Dharanis."
(具梵語。				  Fa Ming bowed deeply in gratitude for his instruction and
薩婆曷剌他悉陀。
中國翻云一切義成。
舊云悉達多。				  departed.
猶是訛¶。

略梵語也)				  There was a Tripitaka Master who asked, "Do changes occur
又問曰︰				  in the Bhutatathata (the Reality, the Absolute) or not?"
「夫經律論是佛語，
讀誦依教奉¶行，
何故不見性？」				  The Master said, "Yes, it has changes."

師曰︰
「如狂狗趁塊，				  The Tripitaka Master said, "Venerable Sir, you are mistaken."
師子齩人。				  The Master asked in return, "Is there a thing called Bhutatathata
¶經律論是自性用，			  or not?"
讀誦者是性法。」

法明曰︰				  The Tripitaka Master replicd, "Yes, there is."
「阿¶彌陀佛有父母及姓否？」

師曰︰					  The Master commented, "lf someone should say that Reality
「阿彌陀姓憍尸¶迦，			  contains no change, he must be an ignorant fellow. Have you not heard
父名月上，				  that a good teacher can change the three poisons (of greed, anger and
母名殊勝妙顏。」			  stupidity) into the three cumulative precepts, transform the six senses
					  into the six supernatural powers, turn defilements into bodhi, and turn
曰︰					  ignorance into the great wisdom? If (you hold that) the Absolute
「出何教文？」				  contains no change, then you, a Master of Tripitaka, are nothing but
					  a heretic."
師¶曰︰
「出
《陀羅尼集》。」			  The Tripitaka Master replied, "If this is so, then the Absolute
法明禮謝，				  does have changes."
讚歎而退。

					  The Master commented, "If you insist on clinging to the idea
有三藏¶法師問︰				  that the Absolute has changes, then you are also proving yourself a
「真如有變易否？」			  heretic."

師曰︰
「有變易。」				  The Tripitaka Master declared, "O Master of Ch'an, you just
					  said that the Absolute has changes, and now you declare that it has
三藏¶曰︰				  no changes! Which is correct?"
「禪師錯也。」

師却問三藏︰				  The Master answered, "When one comprehends the nature of
「有真如否？」				  all things clearly, one is like a crystal jewel which manifests different
					  colors. It is correct to say that it changes, it is also correct to say
曰︰					  that it does not change. When a man does not comprehend and is told
「有。」
					  196
¶師曰︰
「若無變易，
決定是凡僧也。				  that Reality changes, he clings to (the idea of) those .changes; and
豈不聞。				  when he is told of its changelessness, he clings to the changelessness."
善知¶識者，
能迴三毒為三聚淨戒，
迴六識為六神¶通，			  The Tripitaka Master praised him, saying, "Now I truly understand
迴煩惱作菩提，				  that the Southern School of Ch'an is unfathomable."
迴無明為大智真如。
若無¶變易，
三藏真是自然外道也。」			  There was a Taoist follower who asked, "Is there anything in
					  the world more wonderful than Nature?"
三藏曰︰
「若爾者，
¶真如即有變易。」			  The Master said, "Yes, there is."

師曰︰
「若執真如有變易，			  The Tuoist asked, "What can surpass it?"
亦是¶外道。」

曰︰					  The Mastcr answered, "That which completely comprchends
「禪師適來說真如有變易，		  Nature."
如今又道¶不變易，
如何即是的當？」
					  He asked, "Is one's own constitution the Tao? ;'
師曰︰
「若了了見性者，
¶如摩尼珠現色，				  The Master replied, "The constitution is simply the constitution;
說變亦得，				  the Tao is simply the Tao."
說不變亦得。
若不¶見性人，
聞說真如變，				  The Taoist said, "If that is so, then here are two separate things."
便作變解；				  The Master said, "That which knows is not two men."
聞說不變，
便¶作不變解。」
					  The Taoist asked another question: "What is wrong and what
三藏曰︰
「故知南宗實不可測。」
					  is right?"

有道¶流問︰
「世間有法過自然否？」			  The Master answered, "It is wrong for mind to run after things,
					  and it is right for things to follow mind."
師曰︰
「有。」
					  A man named Vinaya Master Yuan came and asked, "Venerable
曰︰					  Sir, when you practice the Way, do you achieve merit?"
「何法過¶得？」				  The Master answered, "Yes, I do."

師曰︰
「能知自然者。」			  He asked, "In what way do you achieve merit?"

曰︰
「元氣是道否？」			  The Master answered, "I take food when I feel hungry, and when
					  I am tired I take a nap."He
師曰︰
「元¶氣自元氣，
道自道。」				  rémarked, "Everyone in the world does that! Does each man
					  leading the same life as you, Venerable Sir, achieve merit?"
曰︰					  The Master answered, "No, he does not."
「若如是者，
則應有二。」
					  He asked, "Why not?"
師¶曰︰
「知無兩人。」
					  The Master answered, "When he takes food he does not eat
又問︰					  whole-heartedly but ponders over hundreds of matters, and when he
「云何為邪？				  takes a nap he does not sleep whole-heartedly but worries about a
云何為正？」				  thousand affairs. Hence, he is not like me."

師
<pb:T_T51n2076_0247c>			  The Vinaya Master was silenced.
¶曰︰
「心逐物為邪，
物從心為正。」				  There was a venerable monk named Yun Kuang who asked,
					  "Master do you know what your next incarnation will be?"
有源律師來¶問︰
「和尚修道還用功否？」
					  The Master answered, "I have not yet died. What is the use of
師曰︰
「用功。」
					  discussing my next life? [ realize that this life rests on the yearning
曰︰					  for knowledge of the unborn, (but) I cannot attempt to affirm the potentialities
「如何用¶功？」				  of the unborn except by the philosophy of that which is born.
					  • The Patriarch has said that the fullness of life is [the other aspect of]
師曰︰					  that which is unborn."
「饑來喫飯，
困來即眠。」
					  Yun Kuang asked', "Can people understand this who have not
					  yet comprehended what the Buddha-nature is?"
曰︰
「一切人總如¶是，
同師用功否？」				  The Master answered, "People who have not themselves
					  comprehended the Buddha-nature are not beings without the Buddhanature.
師曰︰					  Seeing the Buddha-nature is being the Buddha-nature, and there
「不同。」				  is no Buddha-nature which is invisible. Knowledge is Buddha-nature,
					  therefore it is called knowledge-nature. When it is comprehended,
曰︰					  it is no other than Buddha-nature and is called the comprehended
「何故不同？」				  knowledge. That which can beget the ten thousand things is called
					  dharma-nature, or sometimes dharmakaya. Asvaghosa, the Twelfth
師¶曰︰					  Patriarch of the Ch'an transmission, said that the so-called dharma
「他喫飯時不肯喫飯，			  means the mind of sentient beings; and because these minds are born,
百種須索；				  all of the dharmas are born. Dharmas are not born unless the mind
睡時不肯¶睡，				  is born, and accordingly no names can be discriminated. Deluded
千般計校。				  people do not realize the fact that the dharmakaya has no form of
所以不同也。」				  its own, but that it creates forms in accordance with things.
律師杜口。				  Consequently (they say that) green, luxuriant bamboos are all the
					  dhUnnakaya, and that melancholy, dying chrysanthemums can be
有韞光¶大德問︰				  nothing but the expression of prajna. 1f this could be prajna, then
「禪師自知生處否？			  prajna would be the same as non-sentient things! 1f grcen bamboos
」					  could be the dhannakaya, then the dharmakaya would be identical
					  with grass and trees! All people who eat bamboo sprouts would then
師曰︰					  be eating the dharmakaya! How can such talk as this be recorded?
「未曾死，				  While face to face with the Buddha, these people have been worrying
何用¶論生？				  about him for innumerable ages, searching for him everywhere.
知生即是無生法，			  In their delusion, they search for him outside themselves. But those
無離生法說有無生。			  who comprehend the Tao are living within the Tao and do not violate
¶祖師云︰				  the rules of the Tao, regardless of whether they are walking, standing,
『當生即不生。』」			  sitting, or lying down. Those who comprehend the dhanna are totally
					  free wherever they may be."
曰︰
「不見性人亦得如此¶否？」
					  The venerable monk asked again, "Can the universe create
師曰︰					  spiritual wisdom? Does the true mind reflect both the good and the
「自不見性，				  bad? Can a greedy man be in accord with the Tao? lf a man clings
不是無性。				  to right or wrong, will this lead to penetration of mind? Can a man
何以故？				  who cherishes opinions be single-minded when he comes into contact
見即是¶性，				  with objective states? Does a man who dwells in tranquility have
無性不能見；
識即是性，				  198
故名識性；
了即是¶性，
喚作了性；				  wisdom? Is a self-respecting man egotistical? Is a man wise who clings
能生萬法，				  to either voidness or being? Does a man who searches for documentary
喚作法性，				  evidence show wisdom? Or he who seeks the Buddha by engaging
亦名法身。				  in ascetic practices? Is he who seeks Buddha apart from the human
¶馬鳴祖師云︰				  mind in accordance with the Way? Or he who clings to the view that
『所言法者，				  human mind is the Buddha? I beg you, Master of Ch'an, to answer
謂眾生心。				  these questions one by one."
若心生故，
¶一切法生；
若心無生，				  The Master replied, "The universe does not create spiritual
法無從生，				  wisdom; the true mind does not cherish ideas of good ,or bad; the
亦無名字。』				  greedy man is limited in his capacity; a man has not penetrated right
迷¶人不知法身無象，			  and wrong if he strives with others over them; the man who cherishes
應物現形，				  ideas when he comes into contact with objective states has little

欝欝黃華無非般若。			  in wisdom; the self-respecting man is egotistical. The man who clings
黃華若是般¶若，				  to either voidness or being is stupid; the man who searches documents
般若即同無情；				  tior facts becomes more and more impeded by them; he who seeks
翠竹若是法身，				  for the Buddha by engaging in ascetic practice is deluded by it; the
法身即同¶草木。				  man who seeks for the Buddha outside the human mind is a heretic;
如人喫，				  and he who clings to the view that the human mind is the Buddha
筍。					  is a devil."
應總喫法身也。
如此之言，

對面迷佛，
長劫希求，
全體法中，				  one ultimately who is not one of these subjects under consideration."

縱橫自在無非是法。」

					  The venerable monk danced for joy and prostrated himself in

					  State was a man from Lu Chiang; his surname was Ho. When young
是秋，					  he succeeded his father as magistrate of Nan An Prefecture in Ch'uan
與伏牛山¶自在禪師同遊洛陽。		  State; later he became a homeless monk. Early in T'ien Pao era (742755
迴至唐州，				  A.D.) of T'ang he visited Master Ma Tsu, who had established
西見一山，				  his teaching in Chien Yanb and lived in,Buddha Trace Cave. When
四¶面懸絕，				  Ma Tsu later moved to Kung Kung Monastery in Nan K'ang, Tao
峯巒秀異，				  T'ung followed him. Early in February in the fourth year of the era

見有石方正，				  there." The Master did not grasp the meaning of these words.
瑩然紫色，
歎曰︰
「此其¶紫玉也！」			  In the fall of the year he visited Loyang with Master Tzu Tsai

」

¶師云︰					  to the top of the mountain. Looking at the square-cut, glistening stone,
「汝在裏許得多少時也？」		  he recalled the words of his late teacher and realized they were a
					  prediction. Thereupon, he cut down the water-mallows on that spot
僧云︰					  and constructed a house to live in. In later days this was a gatheringplace
「如何出離？」				  for students from all directions,

師云︰					  A monk asked, "What is the way to escape from the three worlds

洛京佛光如滿禪師			  MASTER JU MAN of Hu Kuang Monastery m Loyang, who formerly
(曾，					  lived in Golden Pavilion Temple at Wu T'ai Shan, was asked by
住五臺山金閣寺)				  Emperor Shun Tsung (805 A.D.), "Whenre did the Buddha come,
唐順宗問︰				  and whither has he gone? Ile is sAid to live forever where he is now."
「佛從¶何方來？				  The Master said, "'i'he Buddha came from non-uction and
滅向何方去？
既言常住世，				  206
佛今在何¶
處？」
					  returned to non-action after his extinction. The Dharmakaya is equal
					  to the universe and is the place where mindlessness eternally prevails.
師答曰︰				  Mindfulness returns to mindlessness, and abodefulness returns to
「佛從無為來，				  abodelessness. The coming [of the Buddhaj is for the sake of sentient
滅向無為去，				  beings and the disappearing [of the Buddha) is for the sake of sentient
法身等¶虛空，				  beings. The pure and clean ocean of Reality is profound and everdwelling
常在無心處。				  in its basic nature. Men of wisdom must be fully mindful
有念歸無念，				  of this and never cherish doubts [about it)."
有住歸無住。
¶來為眾生來，
去為眾生去。				  The Emperor then stated, "'I'he Buddha was born in his royal
清淨真如海，				  palace and died at the Twin Grove. Ele preached in the world for 49
湛然¶體常住。				  years and said that there was no teaching to deliver. Mountains, rivers,
智者善思惟，				  oceans, heaven and earth, and the sun and the moon must all return
更勿生疑慮。」				  to something when the time comes. Who can say that he is free from
					  birth and death? Questions like this must arise, and men of wisdom
帝又問︰				  would do well to discern them."
「佛¶向王宮生，
滅向雙林滅，
住世四十九，				  The Master answered, "The Buddha-nature is originally nonaction,
又言無¶法說。				  but those with deluded views discriminate things at random.
山河及大海，				  The Dharmakaya is equal to the universe, and is free of life and death.
天地及日月，				  It appears in the world when sub-causes prevail, and it is extinguished
時至皆歸盡，				  when they pass away. It transforms sentient beings everywhere like the
¶誰言不生滅？				  moon in the water. It is neither permanent nor impermanent. lt is
疑情猶若斯，				  neither living nor dead. It is neither one-not-yet-born nor one-notyet-extinct.
智者善分別。」				  For one who comprehends the mindlessness, there would
					  be no teaching to be delivered,"
師答¶曰︰
「佛體本無為，
迷情妄分別；				  Having heard this sermon, the Emperor was very much pleased
法身等虛空，				  and increasingly esteemed Ch'an teaching.
未¶曾有生滅。
有緣佛出世，
無緣佛入滅，				  MASTER TAO MING of Nan Yuan Monastery in Yuan State once
處處化¶眾生，				  mounted the lecture platform and gave this sermon: "A fast horse
猶如水中月。				  needs only a touch of the whip, and an intelligent man needs only
非常亦非斷，				  a hint. If you have an affair to settle, why don't you come forward
非生亦非滅，				  and discuss it with me? If you have no affair to settle, save
¶生亦未曾生，				  yourselves." Then he descended from the lecture platform.
滅亦未曾滅。
了見無心處，

帝聞大悅，
益重禪宗。¶
					  The Master sighed and said, "I wish I had a tongue broad enough
袁州南源道明禪師，			  and long enough to tell you all about it."
上堂云︰
「快馬一鞭，
快人¶一言。				  Tung Shan came for a Ch'an interview, but when he was about
有事何不出頭來？			  to go up to the lecture platform, the Master announced, "The interview
無事各自珍重。」			  has already finished." Tung Shan then went away from the hall.

有僧問︰
「一言作麼生？」
					  The next day he came back and said, "Yesterday, Master, you

師云︰					  Tung Shan replied, "Putting aside the matter of much learning

師云︰

					  At this, a monk said, "Please, Master, speak straightforwardly

「什麼處得此三昧？」			  Venerable Sir?"

仰云︰
「於曹谿脫¶印子學來。」			  The Master said, "I learned it at Master Ma Tsu's place."

師云︰
「汝道曹谿用此三昧接什麼¶人？」		  Yang Shan asked, "How can one experience the seeing nature?"

仰云︰
「接一宿覺用				  The Master answered, "Suppose that there is a house with six

「和尚什麼¶處得此三昧來？」		  six windows, then, similar responses will be made."

師云︰
「某甲於馬大師處學此¶三昧。」		  Yang Shan bowed in appreciation for the instruction; then standing
					  up he said, "Venerable Sir, I have comprehended all the teaching
問︰					  that you have given through this metaphor. There is only one thing

「若不是仰山，				  When Ma Tsu went into the lecture hall to give a sermon, the
爭得見中邑？				  audience would gather like clouds. Once, just as Ma Tsu seated himself
且道。					  on the dais, Huai Hai rolled up his mat in front of the Master,

二士隨侍馬祖翫月次，
祖					  Ma Tsu hung the dust-whisk back in its place, and Huai Hai kept
<pb:T_T51n2076_0249c>			  silent for a little while. Then Ma Tsu asked, "Hereafter in what way
¶曰︰					  will you serve people by opening the two pieces of skin (of your
「正恁麼時如何？」			  lips)?"

西堂云︰
「正好供養。」				  Huai Hai then took the dust-whisk and held it up.

師云︰
「¶正好修行。」				  Ma Tsu said, "The use of this thing is not to have to use it."

祖云︰
「經入藏，				  Huai Hai hung the dust-whisk back in its place, whereupon Ma
禪歸海。」				  Tsu boomed out, "Ho!" Nuai Hai was deafened and remained so

「只遮箇更別有。			  (Thousand Fathom) Mountain. Even before he had lived there a full

					  directions. Kuei Shan and Huang Po were prominent among them.
祖乃放舊處云︰
「爾已後將什麼何為人？」
¶師却取拂子示之。			  One day the Master said to the congregation, "Buddha-dharma
					  is not a small matter. Oncc, in the past, l was having a Ch'an interview
					  with Master Ma Tsu and he shouted "Ho!" in such a loud voice that
祖云︰					  it made me deaf for three days and made my eyes dark."
「只遮箇，
更別有？」
¶師以拂子挂安舊處。			  When iluang Po heard this story, he was astonished. The Master
方侍立，。				  asked, "Are you not (also) a successor to Ma Tsu?"
祖叱之。
自，
¶此雷音將震，				  Huang Po answered, "No, it is not true. If I were, I could have
果檀信請。				  seen the great activity of Master Ma Tsu when you quoted the story.
於洪州新吳界，				  It is obvious that I have not really known Ma Tsu. And even if 1 had

雄山，
以居處巖巒峻極，
故。					  The Master remarked, "Well said, well said. If a man's insight

既處¶之，				  virtue (authority). Only one whose insight exceeds that of his teacher
未期月，				  will be good enough to have [the dharma] transmitted (to him). You
玄參之賓，				  really have talent surpassing that of your teacher."
四方至，
即有溈山、
黃¶蘗當其首。				  One day a monk came into the lecture hall weeping. The Master
					  asked him, "What is the matter with you?"

一日，
師謂眾曰︰				  The monk said, "I have lost both my father and my mother. Pray,
「佛法不是小事，			  Master, select the day [for the funeral]."
老¶僧昔再蒙馬大師一喝，
直得三日耳聾眼¶黑。」
					  The Master replied, "Come tomorrow, I will bury them
黃蘗聞舉，				  together.'►
不覺吐舌，
曰︰
「某甲不識馬¶祖，			  The Master took his place in the lecture hall and announced, "You
要且不見馬祖。」			  monks are to bring a word of Ch'an while shutting up your throats
					  and lips."
師云︰
「汝已後當嗣馬祖。」
					  Kuei Shan said, "I cannot say it. Please, Master, say it yourself."
黃¶蘗云︰				  The Master responded, "I would not mind saying it for you, but
「某甲不嗣馬祖。」			  if I did I would lose my posterity in far distant days."

曰︰
「作麼生？」				  Wu Feng said, "Master, you also should shut up [your throat
					  and lips to say a word of Ch'an]."
曰︰
「已後喪我¶兒孫。」
					  The Master replied, "I would like to see you in a place where
師曰︰					  no-one is present."
「如是！
如是！」				  211

一日，
有僧哭入法堂¶來，			  Yun Yen said, "I have something to say. Master, please ask me
師曰︰					  the question."
「作麼？」

曰︰					  The Master said, "Bring me quickly a word of Ch'an while
「父母俱喪，				  shutting up your throat and lips."
請師選日。」

師云︰					  Yun Yen answered, "Now, here you are, Master."
「¶明日來，				  The Master remarked, "I may lose my posterity."
一時埋却。」

師上堂云︰				  The Master announced to the congregation: "I need someone who
「					  will deliver my message to Hsi T'ang. Who can go?"
併却咽喉脣吻，
¶速道將來。」
					  Wu Feng responded, '`I can go."

溈山云︰
「某甲不道，				  The Master asked, "How will you deliver my message?"
請和尚道。」				  Wu Feng said, "When I see Hsi T'ang I will speak."
					  The Master asked, "What will you say?"
師云︰
「¶不辭與汝道，
久後喪我兒孫。」			  Wu Feng answered, "I will tell you, Venerable Sir, when I come
					  back."
五峯云︰
「和尚亦¶須併却。」
					  Once when the Master was doing manual work with Kuei Shan
師云︰					  he asked him, "Is there some fire or not?"
「無人處斫額望汝。」

雲巖︰					  Kuei Shan answered, "Yes, there is."
云
「某甲¶有道處，
請和尚舉。」				  The Master pursued, "Where is it?"

師云︰
「併却咽喉脣吻，			  Kuei Shan held up a branch of a tree, blew two or three puffs,
速道¶將來。」				  then passed it to the Master.


雲巖曰︰				  The Master said, "Suppose a worm eats the tree?"
「師今有也。」

師曰︰					  [Someone] asked, "What is the Buddha?"
「喪我兒孫。」

師¶謂眾曰︰				  The Master asked, "Who are you?"
「我要一人傳語西堂，
阿誰去得？」
					  The monk answered, "Just a person."
五峯¶云︰
「某甲去。」
					  The Master asked, "Do you know that person or not?"
師云︰					  The monk answered, "I know him clearly."
「汝作麼生傳語？」

五峯云︰				  The Master then raised his dust-whisk and asked, "Do you see
「待¶見西堂即道。」			  him still?"

師云︰
「道什麼？」				  The monk answered, "Yes, I do."

五峯云︰
「却來說似¶和尚。」			  The Master was then silent.

師與溈山作務次，
師問︰					  On one occasion the monks had all been asked to dig the ground.
「有火也無？」				  When they heard the meal-time drum, one monk came back carrying
					  his mattock and laughing heartily. The Master remarked, "This is
溈山¶云︰				  the gate whereby Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara enters into the doctrine."
「有。」				  When they returned to the temple, the Master sent for the monk

師云︰					  212
「在什麼處？」
溈山把一枝木吹三兩
<pb:T_T51n2076_0250a>			  und asked him, "Why did yUu behave like that just now?"
¶氣，
過與師。
					  The monk answered, "On hearing the sound of the drum I came
師云︰					  back to have dinner."
「如蟲蝕木。」

問︰					  Then the Master laughed.
「如何是佛？」

師¶云︰					  A monk said, "Studying the scriptures in order to comprehend
「汝是阿誰？」				  the principle of the teaching is to be an enemy of (all the) Buddhas
					  in the three periods (of past, present, and future). But how is it when
					  one confuses the teaching through bad theory, even by one letter,
僧云︰					  because one is standing apart from the scriptures?"
「某甲。」

師云︰					  The Master said, "It is being an enemy of the Buddhas of the
「汝識某甲否？」			  three periods to keep firmly to the active function, and it is similarly
					  bad theory to seek for the teaching apart from this. In this connection
僧¶云︰					  (I will tell you a story). Once a monk asked Hsi T'ang, 'When a
「分明箇。」				  question is asked, an answer is given. How is it when no question
					  is asked and no answer is given?' Hsi T'ang replied, 'What is the
師乃舉起拂子云︰			  use of being afraid of over-ripeness?' Having heard this dialogue,
「汝還見麼？」				  their Master remarked, 'I have been suspecting this old senior brother.'
					  The monk said, 'O Master, please explain this matter to me.' Their
僧云︰					  Master answered, 'An atom is not perceivable."'
「¶見。」
師乃不語。
					  The Master said to the congregation, "Here is a man who does not
因普請钁地次，				  say he is hungry, even though he never takes any food at all. Here
忽有一僧。				  is another man who doesn't say he is tired of food, even though he
聞飯¶鼓鳴，				  eats food all day long."
舉起钁頭，
大笑便歸。
師云︰					  Not one member of the congregation responded to this.
「俊哉！
此是觀¶音入理之門。」
					  Yun Yen asked, "Master, for whom do you drive yourself so
師歸院，				  hard every day?"
乃喚其僧問︰
「適來見什¶麼道理便恁麼？」
					  The Master answered, "There is someone here who needs it."
對云︰					  Yun Yen retorted, "Why don't you give him the bother of doing
「適來只聞鼓聲動，			  it himself?"
歸喫¶飯去來。」
師乃笑。
					  A monk asked, "What is the doctrine of the abrupt teaching of
問︰					  the Mahayana?"
「依經解義，
三世
佛怨；					  The Master said, "You must, first of all, stop all your concern
離經¶一字，				  about everything and have a rest. Don't remember anything: good

					  then the sun of wisdom will appear by itself, like the rising sun breaking
					  through clouds. lf the cravings of greediness, anger, love and
因僧問西堂云︰				  grasping can be altogether stopped, if dirt can be made clean and the
「有¶問有答，				  affections exhausted, then one will not be driven by the five desires
不問不答時如何？」			  (of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and touching) nor by the eight
					  winds (which fan the passions), even if one comes face to face with
西堂云︰				  them. Such a man will possess supernatural powers and can make
「怕爛却作¶麼？」			  wonderful demonstrations. This is a man of emancipation. In all
					  objective states, one who is free from being either quiet or confused,
師聞舉，				  and is not caught up in all sounds and colors by either absorbing them
乃云︰					  or scattering them about, is named a man of Tao. A man is regarded
「從來疑遮箇老兄。」			  as having Buddha wisdom only when he is not affected by all the good,
					  bad, dirty, or clean bondage in the active world. When his views on
僧云︰					  right, wrong, lovable and ugly are all exhausted and he cannot be
「請¶和尚道。」				  bound by anything, then he is free in mind and is called a
					  bodhisattva—an initiate in the first degree. ln other words, when he
師云︰					  has climbed to the Buddha-land (he sees that) no things are void in
「一合相不可得。」			  themselves, they do not declare themselves as physical beings, nor
					  do they declare themselves to be right, wrong, dirty or clean. (Not
師謂眾云︰				  being bound himself) neither does he bind the minds of other people.
「有一¶人長不喫飯不道饑，
有一人終日喫飯不道¶飽。」
眾皆無對。				  "Unfortunately, man clings to self-made interpretations hascd

「和尚每日區區為阿¶誰？」		  emancipation, and when he ceases his interpretation of active or
					  inactive, managing his life with equanimity in both life and death,
師云︰					  then he will be free. In the end, he will not be compatible with people
「有一人要。」				  in the empty visionary world; he will live aloof, disregarding all
					  common affairs. His freedom to depart or remain resembles the
巖云︰					  opening of a gate for movement to and fro between life and death.
「因什麼不教伊自¶作？」

師云︰					  "When you encounter various pains and pleasures which are
「他無家活。」				  disagreeable, you should not get bored with them. Don't think about
					  your fame or clothes or food, and don't be greedy about merits and
僧問︰					  profits, or be hindered by worldly matters. However much your mind
「如何是大乘頓悟法¶門？」		  may experience the suffering or comfort of your body, don't let your

師曰︰

					  The monk asked, "What is meant by emancipation of mind?"
「一切諸法，
